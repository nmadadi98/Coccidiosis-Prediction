# Chicken Fecal Image Classification

This project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of chicken feces with the aim of identifying potential health issues based on fecal appearance. The application allows users to upload an image of chicken feces and receive a prediction, thereby assisting in early detection and health management for poultry.
